# proxylock

Proxylock is a Windows application that monitors Internet Proxy Settings and enforces that *proxy auto-configuration* and *configuration via a script* are disabled.

There are (corporate) applications that like to redirect all Web traffic for filtering purposes.

Proxylock will detect such redirections and restore the proxy settings to the previous state.
